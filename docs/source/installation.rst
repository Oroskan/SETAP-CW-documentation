============
Installation
============

The app is built using Flutter and Dart, so it has been designed to be cross-platform.

To use the app, you can either:

* Build it yourself from the source code.
* Download the prebuilt binaries for your platform (if available).

Mobile Platforms
----------------

Android
~~~~~~~

For **Android**, you can simply download and install the ``.apk`` file directly onto your device.

iOS
~~~

For **iOS**:

#. Download the ``.ipa`` file.
#. Sign the app.

.. note::
   You will need to sign the app using either:

   * Your own Apple Developer account.
   * A third-party signing service.


Desktop Platforms
-----------------

Windows
~~~~~~~

For **Windows**, download the ``.exe`` file and run it.

macOS
~~~~~

For **macOS**:

#. Download the ``.app`` file.
#. Run the application.

.. warning::

   As the application is not signed by an identified developer, macOS will show a security warning upon the first launch. You can bypass this in one of the following ways:

   * Right-click (or Control-click) the app icon and select ``Open`` from the context menu. Confirm the prompt to run the application.
   * Go to System Settings > ``Privacy & Security``, scroll down, and explicitly allow the app to run.


Linux
~~~~~

Installation on **Linux** is currently untested, but it should work.

.. note::

   Prebuilt binaries are not provided for Linux. You will need to build the application from the source code yourself.
