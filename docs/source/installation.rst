Installation
------------
The app is built using Flutter and Dart, and has been tested on MacOS, Windows, iOS and Android.
To use the app, you can either build it yourself, or download the prebuilt binaries.

For Android, you can simply install the apk file to your device.
For iOS, you will need to sign the app with your own Apple Developer account, or use a third party service to sign the app for you.

For Windows, you can simply download the exe file and run it.
For MacOS, you can download the app and run it. As the app is not signed, Apple will show a warning when you try to run it. You can bypass this by right clicking on the app and selecting "Open", or allow the app to run in the Privacy & Security settings.
Linux is untested, but should work well. You will have to build the app yourself.
