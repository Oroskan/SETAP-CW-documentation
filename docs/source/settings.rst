**Settings Menu**
=============

The ``SettingsMenu`` module provides a ready‑to‑use profile and preferences screen for Flutter apps.  It is built with *Material 3*, relies on the ``flutter_settings_screens`` package for persistent storage, and supports live *light/dark‑mode switching* through a global ``ValueNotifier<ThemeMode>``.
