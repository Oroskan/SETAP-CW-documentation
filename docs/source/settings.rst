**Settings Menu**
=============

The SettingsMenu module provides a ready‑to‑use profile and preferences screen for Flutter apps.  It is built with 🪄 Material 3, relies on the flutter_settings_screens package for persistent storage, and supports live light/dark‑mode switching through a global ValueNotifier<ThemeMode>.
